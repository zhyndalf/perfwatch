- [x] Created complete SDD directory structure
- [x] Created all constitution documents (vision, principles, glossary)
- [x] Created all specification documents (architecture, api, data-model, metrics, ui)
- [x] Created all plan documents (roadmap, phase 1-4)
- [x] Created Phase 1 task files (T001-T005)
- [x] Created implementation tracking files (decisions, changelog, learnings)
- [x] Created project source directory structure

## What's Next (T002)

1. Create `docker-compose.yml` with all three services
2. Create `backend/Dockerfile` (Python 3.11)
3. Create `frontend/Dockerfile` (Node + Nginx)
4. Create `.env.example` with configuration
5. Create basic `README.md` for the project
6. Verify `docker-compose up` works
